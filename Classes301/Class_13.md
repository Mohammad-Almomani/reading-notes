## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API


1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

   Resources and hypermedia are at the core of the REST architectural framework, which uses HTTP protocols.
   In a database context, the CRUD cycle is used to preserve persistent records. 


2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

    Step 1. Start with your goals and intended users :

    Planning your API strategy is essential for its long-term success. The API should bring value to both its intended users and your organization.

    Step 2. Design the API:

    Before writing the first line of code, you should come up with an architecture that fits your requirements and reflects the needs of developers that will use the API.

    Step 3. Develop your API:

    After you’ve finished your API design, it’s time to build your own API. This is an iterative process. We like to build our APIs one endpoint at a time, gradually adding more functionalities.

    Step 4.Test your API:

    With API virtualization, you can start testing your API before it’s finished. In addition to Unit and Integration tests, you can perform Functional, Reliability, Load, Security, and other kinds of tests.

    Step 5. Monitor your API and iterate on feedback:

    When done with testing and reviewing, it’s time to deploy your API to production. Most enterprise APIs are hosted on API gateways that guarantee high security, performance, and scalability.
