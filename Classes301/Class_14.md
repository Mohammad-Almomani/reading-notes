# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry


## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    When those kids attended college, this was a major issue.
    Computer science teachers began to presume that their students had grown up playing with computers at home as personal computers became more prevalent. 


## Employee breakdown of key technology companies


1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

   Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.


2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    It is not unexpected that a multitude of studies demonstrates a substantial association between diverse companies and favorable financial outcomes given that varied teams are smarter and more creative than homogenous ones.
    Researchers discovered that "female participation in senior management leads to an increase of $42 million in company value" in a 2011 study of diversity in the top companies on Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 ranking. 

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    Alibaba Group

    As the world’s biggest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group serves hundreds of millions of users and hosts millions of merchants. Transactions on its online sites totaled $248 billion in 2017, more than those of eBay and Amazon.com combined.

    The secret to success? Women.

    Taking the goal of gender equality to a deep level, chairman Jack Ma describes women as the “secret sauce” behind Alibaba’s dominance in the online shopping industry. More than one-third of Alibaba Group’s founders were women, and a similar percentage are in senior executive roles.

    Ma went so far as to claim that “women’s perseverance and attention to details will outperform men in the age of robotics and machine learning.”

    When it comes to creating programs that maximize the revenue potential inherent to gender diversity, Alibaba is an excellent example to follow.
