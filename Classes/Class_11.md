## nosql vs sql (Reading)

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

    f  SQL 	NoSQL
    
|Comparison| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Database name | Relational Databases | non-relational Databases |
| Database Base | Table based | Document based | 
| Schema | Predefined schema  | Dynamic schema |
| scalability  | vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| Defining data | Structured query language  | Unstructured Query Language |


2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    SQL databases are good fit for the _`complex query`_ intensive environment


3. Give a real world example.

    * MySql
    * Oracle
    * Sqlite
    * Postgres
    * MS-SQL


4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

      NoSQL database fits better for the `hierarchical data` storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

5. Give a real world example.

    * MongoDB
    * BigTable
    * Redis
    * RavenDb
    * Cassandra
    * Hbase
    * Neo4j 
    * CouchDb

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

     NoSQL

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    NoSQL for horizontally scalable
    SQL for vertically scalable

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

    data records are collections of documents that contain data.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    MongoDB, you can access your data easily and no need to run complex queries to get it.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    lower consistency of information
