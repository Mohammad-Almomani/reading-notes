## Relational Database

The structure of a relational database enables us to locate and retrieve
data in relation to other database data. 
In relational databases, tables are mainly used to organize data.

The actual value of an attribute is stored in a field, whereas each column in a database carries a specific type of data.
 The table's rows are a group of connected values for a single item or entity.
 A primary key, which is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, may be used to link rows from different tables together.
 Without changing the structure of the database tables themselves, there are several ways to retrieve this data.


## SQL

The computer language SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with data kept in a relational database management system.
 Because SQL syntax is comparable to that of English,
 it is generally simple to create, understand, and comprehend.
