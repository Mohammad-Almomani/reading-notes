# Redux Basic

## Fundamentals of Redux

### What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

### Why use Redux?

Redux is a great choice for managing the state of your application. It is a predictable state container that helps you write applications that behave consistently and run in different environments (client, server, and native). It also helps you to write tests that are easier to write and maintain. It is a great choice for managing the state of your application.

## Getting Started With Redux

The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to create an action, an object describing what happened, and dispatch it to the store. To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure reducer functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";

/**
 * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an
 * action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
 * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
 *
 * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.
 * The root state value is usually an object. It's important that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,
 * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.
 */
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "counter/incremented":
      return { value: state.value + 1 };
    case "counter/decremented":
      return { value: state.value - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counterReducer);

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// There may be additional use cases where it's helpful to subscribe as well.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/incremented" });
// {value: 1}
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/incremented" });
// {value: 2}
store.dispatch({ type: "counter/decremented" });
// {value: 1}
```

## Redux Terms and Concepts

### State Management

      State management is the process of managing the state of an application. The state of an application is the data that is used to render the UI. 
      State management is important because it allows you to manage the state of your application in a predictable way.
       It also allows you to manage the state of your application in a way that is easy to test.

        * The state, the source of truth that drives our app;
        * The view, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state
        * The actions, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state
