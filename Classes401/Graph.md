# Graphs

## Introduction to Graphs

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

### Types of Graphs:

1. Finite Graphs - A finite graph is a graph that has a finite number of vertices and edges.
2. Infinite Graphs - An infinite graph is a graph that has an infinite number of vertices and edges.
3. Trivial Graph -A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge.
4. Directed Graphs - A directed graph is a graph where every edge is directed.
5. Simple Graph - A simple graph is a graph that does not contain more than one edge between the pair of vertices. A simple railway track connecting different cities is an example of a simple graph.

## Basic Properties of a Graph

1. A graph is a collection of vertices and edges.
2. A graph can be represented by a matrix or an adjacency list.
3. A graph can be directed or undirected.
4. A graph can be weighted or unweighted.
5. A graph can be cyclic or acyclic.
6. A graph can be connected or disconnected.

## Difference between graph and tree

1. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A graph can be a tree or not a tree.
2. A tree has N-1 edges where N is the number of vertices. A graph may have more or less than N-1 edges.
3. A tree has one root vertex and all other vertices are connected to one parent. A graph may have more than one root vertex or may not have any root vertex.
4. A tree cannot be bipartite. A graph may be bipartite.
5. A tree cannot be directed. A graph may be directed.
6. A tree cannot be weighted. A graph may be weighted.
