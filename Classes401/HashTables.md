# Reading Hash Table

## Hash Table

- A hash table is a data structure that utilizes key value pairs. It is a collection of key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

- Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

- Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the items using a hashed key than to find them using the original value.

- Hashing is used to encrypt data. Hashing is one of the most common ways to encrypt data in transit. It is also used to store passwords so that hackers cannot read the original password.

- Hashing is used in digital signatures between two parties to verify the data integrity and the sender without revealing the private key.

- Hashing is used in the block chain for securing digital currency.

- Hashing is used in the bloom filters for checking whether an element is a member of a set.
