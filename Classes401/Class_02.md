## Readings: Express

1- What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PATCH only updates based on what the user pass, if the user passes a name, only the name will be updated, PUT will update all the information at once.

2- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like json-server

A-[Postman Mock Server](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)

B-[Mockable.io](https://www.mockable.io/)

C-[MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)

3-Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

API Doc: RESTful web APIs' inline documentation is provided by. Your source code's API annotations are used to produce documentation. It provides a default template that outputs the created apidata.js and apiproject.js as an HTML page using handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS, and jQuery.


Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease Using. It is a free cloud-based application for testing APIs and producing their accompanying OpenAPI documentation, making API validation easier.

status code 400: Bad Request

status code 401: Unauthorized

4- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): is a standards-based web services access protocol that has been around for a long time. Originally developed by Microsoft, SOAP isn't as simple as the acronym would suggest.

REST (representational state transfer): is another standard, made in response to SOAP's shortcomings. It seeks to fix the problems with SOAP and provide a simpler method of accessing web services.
